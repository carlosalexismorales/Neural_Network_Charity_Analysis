# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis


## Project Overview

Alphabet Soup, a non-profit foundation, needs help vetting potiental recipients for their donations. We are tasked to predict which are worth donating to and which are too high risk. To help us accomplish this, we are creating a mathematical data driven solution that can do this accurately. A deep learning neural network is designed and trained to evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision making result using the Python TensorFlow library. This model will ultimately help Alphabet Soup determine which organizations should receive donations. 


## Challenge Overview

1. Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. Optimize the Model

## Results


### Preprocessing the Data

The images below contain the code for data preprocessing 

- The EIN, NAME, STATUS, and SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS were neither targets nor features and were removed from the data
- The IS_SUCCESSFUL column was considered the target for the model 
- The APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT, and ASK_AMT columns are considered to be the features of my model.
